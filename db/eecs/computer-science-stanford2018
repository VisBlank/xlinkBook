CS49N | Using Bits to Control Atoms | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=CS49N | instructors:Engler, D. (PI) description:This is a crash course in how to use a stripped-down computer system aboutnthe size of a credit card (the rasberry pi computer) to control as manyndifferent sensors as we can implement in ten weeks, including LEDs, motionnsensors, light controllers, and accelerometers.  The ability to fearlesslyngrab a set of hardware devices, examine the data sheet to see how to usenit, and stitch them  together using simple code is a secret weapon thatnsoftware-only people lack, and allows you to build many interestingngadgets.  We will start with a ``bare metal'' system --- no operatingnsystem, no support --- and teach you how to read device data sheetsndescribing sensors and write the minimal code needed to control themn(including how to debug when things go wrong, as they always do).  Thisncourse differs from most in that it is deliberately mostly about what andnwhy rather than how --- our hope is that the things you are able at the endnwill inspire you to follow the rest of the CS curriculum to understandnbetter how things you've used work. Prerequisites: knowledge of the Cnprogramming language.  A Linux or Mac laptop that you are comfortablencoding on.

CS62N | Let There Be Computations | https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=CS62N | instructors:Reingold, O. (PI) description:The class will discuss the Theory of Computing as an ambitious intellectual endeavor with impact beyond Computer Science.  What are computations? How can their study capture important aspects of the evolution of species, the structure of social networks, and the working of your smart phone? What are the laws of efficiency and complexity that govern computations? We will see surprising algorithms for very familiar problems as well as simple problems no one knows how to solve efficiently. We will encounter logic paradoxes that expose the limitations of computations and explore the different worlds we may be living in, depending on the answers to some of the central problems on computations.n nThe class is intended for students with a wide range of interests. The course will not involve programming. While our class will not rely on any deep mathematics (beyond basic high-school math) we will deal with mathematical formalization of concepts and with mathematical problem-solving. Therefore, some mathematical maturity and interest would be useful.
